# Automatic Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv8

## Description

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system implemented in this project uses the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) deep learning model for real-time and accurate detection and recognition of vehicle number plates in images and video streams. The YOLOv8 model, built on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, is known for its speed and precision, making it an ideal choice for ANPR applications.

The ANPR system processes images or video frames, identifies and localizes license plates, and then extracts the alphanumeric characters from the plates. It's designed to handle different license plate formats, including various fonts, colors, and sizes. The project provides an easy-to-use command-line interface and can be easily integrated into existing applications or used as a standalone tool.

## Main Features

- **Real-Time ANPR:** Fast and efficient detection and recognition of number plates in real-time video streams.
- **Accurate Localization:** Precisely locates the position of number plates within images or video frames.
- **Alphanumeric Extraction:** Extracts the alphanumeric characters from the license plates for further processing.
- **Customization:** Users can fine-tune the ANPR system using their datasets to adapt it to specific regions or license plate formats.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** The project uses lightweight libraries to ensure easy setup and deployment.
- **CLI Interface:** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for convenient usage.

Whether you're building a traffic monitoring system, a parking management application, or conducting research in computer vision, this Automatic Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 offers a powerful and flexible solution.
